## Three-Dimensional Robotic Vascular Imaging System
---
System integrating robotic technology and three-dimensional imaging capabilities, it can accurately locate and scan blood vessels, generate clear three-dimensional vascular structure images, provide intuitive spatial information support for vascular disease diagnosis, interventional therapy, etc., and features both operational flexibility and imaging precision.

## Photoacoustic/Ultrasound Image-Guided Robotic Visual Servoing Task
---
The robot visual servoing task guided by photoacoustic/ultrasound images integrates multimodal images from photoacoustics (providing high-contrast functional information) and ultrasound (offering deep-penetration structural information). It extracts target features in real time, calculates motion deviations via visual servoing algorithms, and drives the robot to dynamically adjust its posture, forming a closed loop of "image feedback-motion correction". This enables high-precision tracking, positioning, or manipulation of targets, combining imaging complementarity and real-time control, and is applicable to scenarios such as precision medicine.

## Continuum robot mechanism design and kinematic control
---
We have completed the design of three sets of continuum robot mechanisms with distinct functions. Among them, one continuum robot is capable of tracking surgical instruments using a constant curvature motion model, and we have also developed an umbrella-shaped probe for gastric cancer detection. Additionally, by leveraging the Cosserat model, we have achieved accurate estimation of the flexible segment of the continuum robot and realized precise control of its position and posture under force control.
