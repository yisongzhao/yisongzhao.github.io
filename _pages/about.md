Here is Yisong ZHAO. I'm now a first year PhD student in the [Advanced Bio-Medical Robotics Lab](https://research.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/lizhengrobotics/), [Department of Surgery](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. LI Zheng](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/profile.asp?alias=zli).I am mainly engaged in research on medical robots based on image navigation, including research on in-vivo continuous robot control algorithms based on ultrasound image navigation and research on in-vivo robotic arm servo algorithms based on photoacoustic navigation.

Before joining CUHK, I obtained my undergraduate and graduate degrees from the [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in France, majoring in [EEA(Electrique Energie Automatique)](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/licences-0/licence-discipline/les-l2-l3-nos-huit-3) and minoring in [Mathematics](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research-areas/mathematics).

## Research Interests
1. Photoacoustic probe design
2. Photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging, image reconstruction
3. Medical robots based on photoacoustic/ultrasound image guidance
4. Continuous robot mechanism design for use in narrow spaces in the body, kinematic/dynamic control
