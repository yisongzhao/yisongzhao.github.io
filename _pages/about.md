Welcome to my homepage! I'm a M.Phil. student in the [Advanced Bio-Medical Robotics Lab](https://research.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/lizhengrobotics/), Department of Surgery, [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK), supervised by [Prof. LI Zheng](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/profile.asp?alias=zli). I'm dedicated to studying and modeling medical procedures and delivering innovative and effective engineering solutions, including robotics and computer science, to improve their quality, efficiency, safety, and availability.

Prior to CUHK, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering (computer engineering stream) from [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2023, during which I spent three wonderful years learning and working in the [Robotics & AI Lab](https://rail.cuhk.edu.cn/) under the mentorship of [Prof. QIAN Huihuan](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/qianhuihuan) (marine robotics group) and [Prof. SUN Zhenglong](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/sunzhenglong) (surgical robotics group).
