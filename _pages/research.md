My research journey began in CUHK-Shenzhen [Robotics & AI Lab](https://rail.cuhk.edu.cn/) (RAIL). I'm fortunate to have [Prof. Zhenglong Sun](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/sunzhenglong) and [Prof. Huihuan Alex Qian](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/qianhuihuan) to guide me in research and train my sense of science & engineering. I have a broad range of research interests in 
* **_Image- and force-guided robotic systems:_** visual servoing, hybrid force/motion control, motion planning with visual and haptic feedback, etc
<!-- * **_Medical robotics:_** robotics-powered medical image acquisition and analysis, medical procedure autonomy, deformable tissue manipulation, etc -->
* **_Bio-inspired robotics,_** as it can be one way we learn about nature

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. --- Richard Feynman

I'm eager to devote myself to solving and understanding **fundamental** scientific problems in practical engineering.
