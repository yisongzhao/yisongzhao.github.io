## Introduction

This project was a research project I participated in at CUHK-Shenzhen, supervised by <a href='https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/qianhuihuan'>Prof. QIAN Huihuan</a>, 2020 ~ 2021. Inspired by [kites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite) (no matter which direction the wind blows, as long as you reel in the rope, the kite will eventually return to your hands), I assisted a Ph.D. student ([Mr. LIU Chongfeng](https://chongfengliu.github.io/)) in proposing and implementing a tethered landing system that makes the UAV capable of landing on small and disturbed platforms.

The proposed system is suitable for both single and multiple UAV marine platforms.

## Follow up
An improved version was used as the ***end effector*** in CUHK-Shenzhen Robotics & AI Lab marine robotics group's [manipulator-assisted UAV landing](/projects/floating-manipulator/) project.
