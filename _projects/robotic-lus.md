## Introduction

This project was a research project I participated in at CUHK, supervised by [Prof. LI Zheng](https://www.surgery.cuhk.edu.hk/profile.asp?alias=zli) and [Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/pheng-ann-heng/), 2023 ~ 2024. This project aimed to use robots to perform autonomous point-of-care lung ultrasound examinations in ICUs to reduce the risk of infection for clinicians during epidemics. I contributed to this project as the robot development lead, prototyped a robotic lung ultrasound system and assisted in its preclinical validation.

## Demo

Here is a video demo of our system performing lung ultrasound examination of the anterior-superior region of a volunteer through the second and third intercostal spaces.
